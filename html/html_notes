All html tags are opening and closing
  ex: <p> this is a paragraph </p>

Html tags can be nested one inside another
  ex: <p> this is a prargraph <em>  with emphasized text </em> inside another paragraph </p>
  
A DOM (Document Object Model) tree can be made from the nesting of html tags
DOM tree comes into play when using CSS and JS
Browser also uses DOM tree to create an accessability tree
